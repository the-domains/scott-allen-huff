Our juv. **Red Striped Eartheater** Cichlid - (_Geophagus surinamensis_) in the 125 last night. The Latin name "_Geophagus_" means "eartheater". This fish was donned with that name for its feeding behavior of sifting through mouthfuls of detritus from the riverbed. They originate from Guyana in South America and the vast majority of these commercially available fish are captive bred while some wild caught specimens are imported from time to time. These are often found in the quiet pools of collecting water after it cascades in the rivers sifting through silt and mud for food and between the tree roots and rock caves with slow flowing water. These are also known to make sounds with the teeth in its throat (pharyngeal teeth), but the reason such sounds are made is not known. Biologists assume these sounds to be a form of communication or to warn off predators.

They are larvophile mouth-brooders (partial mouth-brooder) and are pretty difficult to sex. Some say that the females are more silvery than their male counterpart or that she has slightly longer fins but this is not a proven characteristic. They are however pretty easy to breed if provided the right tank conditions. A sandy bottom, a cave made of a tipped flower pot with a few cryptocoryne plants near the opening for seclusion, and a nice flat rock for the female to lay her 250 or so eggs upon will work well. The female will take the eggs into her mouth shortly before they are larval and after hatching, they will be protected at night and in times of danger for several weeks. They will eat literally all types of foods, but prefer a meaty diet of, black or blood worms, beef heart, shrimp and the like. My water parameter recommendations are a pH of 6.5 to 7.8, Hardness 80 to 320 ppm, temp 74-82 deg F, and a dH at 5-19 deg.
